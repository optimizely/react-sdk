You can use ODP, a high-performance [Customer Data Platform (CDP)]( https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/customer-data-platform/), to easily create complex real-time segments (RTS) using first-party and 50+ third-party data sources out of the box. You can create custom schemas that support the user attributes important for your business, and stitch together user behavior done on different devices to better understand and target your customers for personalized user experiences. ODP can be used as a single source of truth for these segments in any Optimizely or 3rd party tool.  

With ODP accounts integrated into Optimizely projects, you can build audiences using segments pre-defined in ODP. The SDK will fetch the segments for given users and make decisions using the segments. For access to ODP audience targeting in your Feature Experimentation account, please contact your Customer Success Manager. 

This release leverages the Optimizely JavaScript SDK 5+

This version includes the following changes: 

- New APIs added to `ReactSDKClient`: 

	- `fetchQualifiedSegments()`: this API will retrieve user segments from the ODP server. The fetched segments will be used for audience evaluation. The fetched data will be stored in the local cache to avoid repeated network delays. 

  - `getUserContext()`: get the current `OptimizelyUserContext` object in use at the React SDK level.
  
  - `getVuid()`:  provides access to the anonymous client-side visitor ID (VUID) generated by the JS SDK. This ID is used to identify unique visitors in Optimizely Results in the absence of a standard user ID.
  
  - `sendOdpEvent()`: customers can build/send arbitrary ODP events that will bind user identifiers and data to user profiles in ODP.

	- `fetchQualifiedSegments()`: this API will retrieve user segments from the ODP server. The fetched segments will be used for audience evaluation. The fetched data will be stored in the local cache to avoid repeated network delays. 

	- When an `OptimizelyUserContext` is created, the SDK will automatically send an identify request to the ODP server to facilitate observing user activities. 

- New APIs added to `OptimizelyClient`: 

	- `sendOdpEvent()`: customers can build/send arbitrary ODP events that will bind user identifiers and data to user profiles in ODP. 

	- `createUserContext()` with anonymous user IDs: user-contexts can be created without a userId. The SDK will create and use a persistent `VUID` specific to a device when userId is not provided.
