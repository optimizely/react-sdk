## [Unreleased]

## [2.8.0] - January 26, 2022

### New Features
- Add a set of new APIs for overriding and managing user-level flag, experiment and delivery rule decisions. These methods can be used for QA and automated testing purposes. They are an extension of the ReactSDKClient interface ([#133](https://github.com/optimizely/react-sdk/pull/133)):
  - setForcedDecision
  - getForcedDecision
  - removeForcedDecision
  - removeAllForcedDecisions
- Updated `useDecision` hook to auto-update and reflect changes when forced decisions are set and removed ([#133](https://github.com/optimizely/react-sdk/pull/133)).
- For details, refer to our documentation pages: [ReactSDKClient](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/reactsdkclient), [Forced Decision methods](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/forced-decision-methods-react) and [useDecision hook](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/full-stack/v4.0/docs/usedecision-react).
